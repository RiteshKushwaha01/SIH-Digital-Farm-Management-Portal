## Key Features Implementation

### Risk Assessment Algorithm
The risk calculation considers multiple factors:
- Farm location (rural/suburban/urban)
- Animal count and type
- Hygiene practices rating
- Vaccination status
- Biosecurity measures implementation

**Risk Score Formula:**
```
Risk Score = Location Risk (0-20) + Animal Count Risk (0-20) + 
             Hygiene Risk (0-20) + Vaccination Risk (0-20) + 
             Biosecurity Risk (0-20)
```

### Alert System
- **High Risk**: Security breaches, disease outbreaks
- **Medium Risk**: Maintenance due, vaccination reminders
- **Low Risk**: Routine notifications, status updates

### Compliance Tracking
- **Vaccination Records**: Track vaccination schedules and status
- **Hygiene Checks**: Monitor cleaning and sanitization
- **Biosecurity Protocols**: Ensure proper implementation
- **Training Records**: Track staff training completion
